Do you want to...
 - ‚öîÔ∏è Know every weapon and kill every enemy? 
 - üè† Make bases in many environments? 
 - üåæ farm anything and everything, including crops?

 - üõ£Ô∏è Build transit infrastructure and achieve ludicrous speed?

*Godseeking* will guide you through it like a hand-holding in-game wiki. How many quests are there? uhhh

![godseeking](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/184521370-e99c164c-7289-4634-8a5d-16e3b63da9ba.png)

Some. [They reveal as you play to mitigate players getting overwhelmed]

These quests can help players discover these parts of the game, and have rewards to provide helpful shortcuts.     
Complete all quests of a special interest to complete its **Patron Quest** for normally unobtainable rewards!

<img width="380" height="400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174103926-52a741ac-6d36-44e4-8153-be5fb7aff6c1.png"><img width="380" height="400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174105386-7985c35c-fc25-4d8b-bb5a-724d55a7ebf7.png">

**Introduction** quests cover's the pack's main features, while **Discrepancies** quests helps players know what isn't vanilla.

## Homebrew Changes

We get it - packs that just throw mods together are no fun. Here's what we pulled together besides curation:

 - Six mods: 
   - [Portable Crafting Standalone](https://modrinth.com/mod/portable-crafting-standalone) - Press V or click a tab to use the crafting table in your inventory. 
   - [Totem Anywhere Standalone](https://modrinth.com/mod/totem-anywhere-standalone) - Totem of undying convenience - uses totems from inventory.  
   - [Crunchy Crunchy Advancements](https://modrinth.com/mod/crunchy-crunchy-advancements) - Hides and removes advancements - quests and [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) covers all you need.
   - [Tinkerer's Statures](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-statures) - Allows choosing player height on spawn.
 
![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174215100-2b630688-8ef5-4429-b82e-9516c132915a.png)

   - [Origins Minus](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins-minus) - A full set of origins optimised for simplicity, not balance.
 
![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/192087501-c157859b-1307-4de4-a88d-f2c61391edf9.png)

- - [Tinkerer's Smithing](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-smithing) - Repair for no XP cost, lower repair cost with scrap, and upgrade tool materials.
     - Flattens mending power creep, encouraging players to keep "Sentimental" tools as much as they like.
     - Tool material upgrades cost the exact same as a fresh tool - but keep the enchantments.
     - Quicker tools with less waste - upgrade wood to stone to iron from the 2x2 crafting grid.

![tinkerers-smithing-banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/184521392-5f0ddbd5-e9f5-4c7a-8262-ecb265e2e6cd.png)

- - [Switchy](https://modrinth.com/mod/switchy) - Change your origin, skin, and more between presets with a single command.

![switchy banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/185277937-60b55666-07b9-46d3-881b-0f45ea39fb73.png)

 - Four data packs: (use [this](https://download-directory.github.io) for downloads)
   - [Tinkerer's Vegetarian](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_vegetarian) (NBT) - recipes for potions, leather, books, and more, without killing passive mobs.
   - [Tinkerer's Copper Beacons](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_copper_beacons) - Allows beacons made of unexposed copper blocks. A use for Copper and Wax!
   - [Tinkerer's Human't](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.18.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_humant) (Origins) - Removes mention of "human" and "nitwit" from origins descriptions.
   - [WIP] Fresh and reworked Origins following TQuilt's design - Prioritizing simplicity over balance.
 - Mod Configuration:
   - 194 Quests over 6 categories in Base (FTB Quests)
     - Just as many flavour text subtitles - queer humour, observations, and a weird mix of references.
     - An unholy amount of quest descriptions - how to achieve the task, what the required items do, etc.
     - Meticulously symmetrical and categorized quest positioning. No really. Hours of it.
   - Tracking and removing mod feature-overlap. Also sorting out memorable keybindings, apparently.
 - Hyper-meticulous design nonsense - Curation (yes), playtesting, feature overlap, quest flow...
   - This is still an endorsement, promise.
   - There was a lot of notepad documents and messy organisation systems to get this done. 
   - This project started in january 2021 as a skyrim-style "modding guide" for fabric. Not joking.
- Pull Requests to other mods!
    - [Preserve Cursor Stack](https://github.com/Andrew6rant/InventoryTabs/pull/47) in Inventory Tabs
    - [Show RepairCost](https://github.com/Queerbric/Inspecio/pull/94) in Inspecio without F3+H for smithing.
 - Reporting a tonne of bugs and incompatibilities to mod developers. And quilt developers.
     - That's an endorsement too.
     - Thanks everyone.

## Features from Mods

All present minecraft modding is built on a decade of work from other people (and non-people, we don't discriminate).   

The rest of the cool stuff is just us bringing together the work of great modders in the community.    
Shoutouts are well-deserved here, so we're dropping links for all these major features. 

### Player Expression

Letting players express themselves with player customisation, builds, and even things like farming, cooking, and brewing, is a core tenet of the pack.
    
 - [Ears](https://ears.unascribed.com/) - Improved skins with support for tails, horns, ears, claws, wings and more species/gender things!
 - [Fabric Tailor](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabrictailor) - Swap your skin in-game. Great for plural systems.
 - [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins) - Choose a player _Origin_, granting abilities, limitations, and maybe some euphoria (we don't know you)

 - [Drogtor](https://github.com/unascribed/Drogtor) - Change your player name at any time with a command!
 - [Player Pronouns](https://modrinth.com/mod/player-pronouns) - Set your pronouns in multiplayer to show in the player list.
 - [Fabrication](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabrication) - A huge tweak mod. Includes allowing players to hide armor to show their skin with a command.
 - [Presence Footsteps](https://modrinth.com/mod/presence-footsteps) - Footstep audio redone - allows swapping between bi/quadrupedal, with winged options.


 - [Carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) - A collection of tweaks. Here - it includes more dispenser functionality, for mechanics!
 - [Fabrication](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabrication) - Many minor tweaks to improve minecarts and train systems - for transit lovers.

## Usability and Accessibility

 - [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) - An advanced recipe book that lets players find information on any item, and help craft it.
 - [What The Hell Is That?](https://modrinth.com/mod/wthit) - Hold alt to see information on the block or mob you're looking at.     
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174112665-b8b534e2-5b8d-450e-91dd-260869086719.png)
 - [Notes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/notes-fabric) - Allows players to take in-game notes about their plans, locations to revisit, etc.
 - [Reacharound](https://modrinth.com/mod/reacharound) - Build midair bridges without sneaking, and even downwards stairs.
 - [Project: Save The Pets!](https://modrinth.com/mod/projectsavethepets) - Prevents pet harm and adds a pet revival system.
 - [Horse Buff](https://modrinth.com/mod/horsebuff) - Improves and protects horses, making them easier to take out on adventures.
 - [Fabrication](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabrication) - A multitude of minor improvements, such as automatic block pickup and crawling.
 - [You're In Grave Danger](https://modrinth.com/mod/yigd) - Leaves a grave on death with your items and XP that won't de-spawn.
 - [Apathy](https://modrinth.com/mod/apathy) - Mobs are neutral on easy difficulty, and will only attack you if provoked.

## Visuals

 - [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - Present-day holy grail of performance mods.
 - [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - Optifine-compatible shaders. We recommend [Complementary](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) or [Super Duper Vanilla](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/super-duper-vanilla-shaders/files/).
 - Many more! Check out the modlist.

# Other Editions

We're working on some companion editions to release... eventually. Currently hosted builds are for testers.

The base version is designed to allow more experienced players to add extra mods.            
**Plus** and **Modded** is simply us doing exactly that - to our own tastes!

- [WIP] **Plus** is a Vanilla+ extension of base.
    - Plus adds mods that expand on the **Godseeking** fields from base:
        - **Homesteading** - More farming/ranching, _way_ more cooking, more building blocks, and more decorations.
        - **Exploration** - More traversal options, new nether/end, new biomes, new structures, and a seasonal world.
        - **Combat** - Spears, chef's knives, and... compact mechanically propelled halfdoors? Plus new dungeons.
- [WIP] **Modded** an extension of plus, adding personal favourite large mods
    - Each mod is larger, with a complex progression equivalent to Base's **The Basics** tree, and then some.
    - **Botania** - Collect mana, power magic flowers, and study the elves in this beautifully simple magi-tech mod.
    - **Create** - Build steampunk masses of driveshafts, pistons, and conveyors in this larger-than-life old-tech mod.
    - **Hephaestus** - Tinker's Construct 3 is our favourite tool/weapon rework - ever.
