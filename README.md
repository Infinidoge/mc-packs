# Infinidoge's Modified Tinkerer's Quilt

This is my modified version of TQuilt with some minor additions.
The more 'weighty' additions will be seen on the Plus/Modded branches.
Just in case things get upstreamed somehow, I'm trying to maintain the version differences between Base/Plus/Modded.

<b>Tinkerer's Quilt</b> (TQuilt) is a minecraft modpack by Kapesi, Clawby, Herrah and Le'mer.<br/>
It focuses on <b>Vanilla Gameplay</b>, <b>Accessibility</b>, <b>Discoverability</b>, <b>QoL</b>, and <b>Player Expression</b>.<br/><br/>It's built on Quilt, and has Modrinth and Packwiz releases. Check out the <b>Installation</b> section below.</center>

---


Tinkerer's Quilt is *vanilla world compatible*, with **no new items, blocks, or worldgen**.

Instead, this modpack:
- **Guides players through vanilla** with in-game quests and info - no wiki required.
- **Enhances game Quality of Life** improvements for accessibility and smoother gameplay.
- **Makes the game easier** with simplified gear crafting, reduced death penalty, and helpful quest rewards.
- **Encourages player expression** with better skins, origins, and more ways to build.

TQuilt is not a client or minimalist pack! It has ~120 mods and should be installed on both sides.

***"It's like FTB Academy for Vanilla!"*** - Us, just now

TQuilt's quests guide players through the core progression of minecraft, and explore its main gameplay opportunities.

### The Basics

<img width="425" height="260" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174097642-a5949541-b8e6-419b-bbfe-b3e4ecf90be8.png"><img width="325" height="260" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174098114-c5630f29-efaa-4473-9eb4-e53c4325f002.png">

*The Basics* covers core game progression - Simple quests with clear instructions, all the way to Beacons and Elytra.

### Godseeking
Explore the main mechanics and content of Vanilla, categorised by **Homesteading**, **Self-Defense**, and **Exploration**.   
Do you want to...<br/>

‚öîÔ∏è Know every weapon and kill every enemy?<br/>
üè† Make bases in many environments?<br/>
üåæ farm anything and everything, including crops?<br/>
üó∫Ô∏è Explore the world and what's found there?<br/>
üõ†Ô∏è Craft the best gear in your own workshop?<br/>
üõ£Ô∏è Build transit infrastructure and achieve ludicrous speed?<br/>
‚öôÔ∏è Make terrifyingly complex machines and mechanisms?

*Godseeking* will guide you through it like an in-game wiki.            
Here's the Homesteading category with all quests hacked to be visible, as an example of scope:

![godseeking_homesteading](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/207265090-0cc4dd88-07b5-492c-81ef-0cf85f5cba68.png)

These quests can help players discover these parts of the game, and have rewards to provide helpful shortcuts.     
Complete all quests of a special interest to complete its **Patron Quest** for normally unobtainable rewards!

This modpack started in January 2021 as a skyrim-style "modding guide" - just throwing mods together and configuring them lightly.

But it quickly took shape when we realized people often struggle to get past the first half-hour of the game.

Turns out if you want a modpack to feel cohesive, feel good, and match a vision - you need to get your hands dirty.

We made **six mods**:

[Portable Crafting Standalone](https://modrinth.com/mod/portable-crafting-standalone) - Press V or click a tab to use the crafting table in your inventory.<br/>
[Totem Anywhere Standalone](https://modrinth.com/mod/totem-anywhere-standalone) - Totem of undying convenience - uses totems from inventory.<br/>
[Crunchy Crunchy Advancements](https://modrinth.com/mod/crunchy-crunchy-advancements) - Hides and removes advancements - quests and [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) cover all you need.<br/><br/>
[Tinkerer's Statures](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-statures) - Allows choosing player height on spawn.<br/>
![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174215100-2b630688-8ef5-4429-b82e-9516c132915a.png)<br/><br/>
[Origins Minus](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins-minus) - A full set of origins optimised for simplicity, not balance.<br/>
![originsminus_transparent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/207250617-c4d83703-817c-47b7-8ddf-d2e915807df4.png)<br/><br/>
[Tinkerer's Smithing](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkerers-smithing) - Repair for no XP cost, lower repair cost with scrap, and upgrade tool materials.<br/>
![tinkerers-smithing-banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/207277119-c8b933ce-1055-4a48-95b6-ad7d83e09b8a.png)<br/>
*Flattens mending power creep, encouraging players to keep "Sentimental" tools as much as they like.*<br/>
*Tool material upgrades cost the exact same as a fresh tool - but keep the enchantments.*<br/>
*Quicker tools with less junk - upgrade wood to stone to iron from the 2x2 crafting grid.*<br/><br/>
[Switchy](https://modrinth.com/mod/switchy) - Change your origin, skin, and more between presets with a single command.
![switchy banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/207276993-bd723741-8f33-485f-8495-2961007b7e89.png)<br/><br/>

**Two data packs**:

[Tinkerer's Vegetarian](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.19.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_vegetarian) (NBT) - recipes for potions, leather, books, and more, without killing passive mobs.<br/>
[Tinkerer's Copper Beacons](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/tree/quilt_1.19.2/config/openloader/data/tinkerers_copper_beacons) - Allows beacons made of unexposed copper blocks. A use for copper and wax.<br/>

**194 quests**:<br/>

just as much flavour text - queer humour, observations, and a weird mix of references.<br/>
1074 lines of quest descriptions - tutorials, explanations, and so on.<br/>
Meticulously symmetrical and grouped quest positioning. No, really.<br/>

**And of course, configured ~125 mods:**

You know - removing feature overlap, rebalancing mods,<br/>rebalancing vanilla via tweak mods. (Shoutouts to Fabrication and Apathy)<br/>
Ruining everyone's life by shipping a default `options.txt` file.<br/>
PR'ing improvements to mods. (*does it count as configuration if you apply it directly to the source code?*)<br/>
Reporting bugs to devs. (*does it count as configuration if you "configure" the mod to work better by asking nicely?*)<br/>

All present minecraft modding is built on a decade of work from other people (and non-people, we don't discriminate).

Here's what others are bringing to this pack.

### Player Expression

Letting players express themselves with player customisation, builds, and even farming and cooking, is core to TQuilt.


| Mod                                                               | Description                                                                                      |

| [You're In Grave Danger](https://modrinth.com/mod/yigd)                                                         | Leaves a grave on death with your items and XP that won't de-spawn.                |

## Alpha Versions
</center>

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand</summary>

Tinkerer's Quilt is designed to allow players to add their own mods.            
**Plus** and **Modded** is us giving that a shot - but it's **not ready for release yet**.

**The packwiz version is not save safe. Do not use the auto updater if you are keeping a save.**

- **Plus** is a Vanilla+ extension of base, expanding on **Godseeking**:
  - **Homesteading** - More farming/ranching, much more cooking, more building blocks, and more decorations.
  - **Exploration** - More traversal options, new nether/end, new biomes, new structures, and a seasonal world.
  - **Combat** - Spears, chef's knives, and... compact mechanically propelled halfdoors? Plus new dungeons.
- **Modded** uses TQuilt as a base for heavy content mods, like [Botania](https://modrinth.com/mod/botania), [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric), [Yttr](https://modrinth.com/mod/yttr), and [Hephaestus](https://modrinth.com/mod/hephaestus).
